URLO is a simple C program that opens a user-defined list of URLs on their system's default browser. 

**How to Use**

Download the zip folder and extract it. Open urls.txt and enter your desired URLs to open, ensure that each URL is on its own line. Make sure to keep the .exe and urls.txt in the same directory (folder). 

I would recommend making a shortcut to urlo.exe on your desktop or somewhere else that is easy to access.
