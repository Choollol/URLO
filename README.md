# URLO

URLO is a simple C program that opens a user-defined list of URLs on their system's default browser. 

**How to Use**

Download the folder and open urls.txt. Make sure to keep the .exe and urls.txt in the same directory (folder). Open urls.txt and enter your desired URLs to open, ensure that each URL is on its own line.

I would recommend making a shortcut to urlo.exe on your desktop or somewhere else that is easy to access.
